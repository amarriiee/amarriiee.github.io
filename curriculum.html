        <br>People in the United States blame students and kids for not paying enough attention and using their time in 
        education and they believe that all of the students are responsible for the destruction of their own career 
        due to lack of attention and concentration in education; however, students are suffering in education and 
        failing to achieve a great career due to several kind of crisis in American education. Children cannot be 
        blamed alone for their poor career but people have to provide them space and opportunities for them so that 
        they can achieve something. There are other crisis in education; therefore, we cannot blame them for 
        failing to achieve a great career.

                In most schools, teachers are teaching the exact same subject matter as they taught in early 2000s. 
                Problem-solving, creative skills, digital skills and collaboration are in greater need every year yet 
                they are not taught in the schools. These skills are very important for the future of the students as 
                it helps them both mentally and physically.

                <br>Curriculum given to students do not contain the advanced and modern contents. 
                They are often outdated and students cannot learn the advanced contents. This let students suffer 
                when they go for higher educational level. Curriculum does not provide the basics which are needed 
                by a student for further education. Instead, the current education is teaching us outdated skills 
                designed for the industrial era and ignoring modern history; a modern history that will dictate the 
                career paths of current students.

                The current education system of America is not giving students enough space to learn what they should 
                learn at their level. Despite the advancement of last fifty years, schools do not have the technologies 
                which are provided to other places. Students do not get to learn the contents that are available only in 
                some advanced technological devices, which are essential for them to know for their future. Technology is 
                giving people many new ways to learn something physically by seeing, reacting, and even by interactions. 
                Instead of the teacher being the only source of help in a classroom, students can access websites, online 
                tutorials, and more to assist them. This help students learn faster and helps in developing their 
                thinking. It allows people to catch something quickly and memorize it quickly without getting confused 
                most of the time. Not providing technology to students will make their learning power weaker as well as 
                provide them with backdated contents.

                <br>In America, students are often misplaced under different curriculum and subjects which does not benefit 
                them for their career. Students are taken away from their goal where they get confused and do not fit well. 
                As a result, many students often dislike school and drops out and sometimes get depressed. The teaching 
                routine given to students are sometimes out of order which affect the students due to depression, and 
                disliking education.
