              District location can determine the student experience in PA as a whole. The higher the taxes, the more difficult the funding is for schools; in Philadelphia taxes are really high so school funding is difficult to apprehend. Two years ago, 10% of schools in Philly closed down. 
              <br>  Philadelphia has the fourth lowest operational revenue per student among major cities. 1.15% of the Philadelphia Budget goes to education.

              African Americans/Hispanics have a difficult time after school, they experience joblessness, poverty and low income. White people usually get into more schooling, and fulfill their careers because of their privilege in having heavily funded schools out of the Philadelphia District.
              <br> Throughout the city, excluding the selective admission schools (Masterman, Central, etc), only 36% of high school graduates in the Philadelphia School District go to college.

              “Racist status quo;” where wealthy white children receive the best education, and are prone to succeed while other children (African American or Hispanic) struggle to succeed or end up in poverty.
              <br> A lawyer of the Public Interest law Center, Michael Churchill said in an interview, "If the legislature continues to shortchange schools, a child's opportunities will continue to be determined by the accident of their zip code." Students are being held accountable not by their intelligence, but by their location.
<br> Over 15,000 of students in Philadelphia are stranded in schools that are considered failing according to the Department of Education. 70% of these students are African American and 79% are living in poverty.
