          My name is Ashanti Morrison. I am 16 years old, and a junior in Community Academy of Philadelphia High School.             <br> I am planning on going to school to be a Cosmetic Dermatologist. I would like to get my bachelor's degree at Temple, and  
          <br> my master's at the University of Pennsylvania. I decided to do the Tech-It Out Internship because it's art of my personality to try 
          <br> new things. Computers has never been a thought of mine, so why not see what it's all about. I had a lot of fun learning about the different 
          <br> codes, and it's amazing how something so complex can make something look so simple.

       You have reached the end congrats! My name is Alyssa Marie Long.I grew up in north philly and currently attend Constitution High School as a 10th grader. 
          <br> Iâ€™m also the Vice President of constitution. I plan on majoring computer Science or programming in college. Growing up in my day of age, technology is what surrounds us which lead me to digging an interest. 
          <br> My elders would always encourage me into going for a field of technology each time I completed the most simplest task such as rerouting the WiFi box, fixed a phone screen, or jailbroke something (shhhh).
          <br> I never took it to heart until I learned about coding. After further researching the career I learned about how not much women of color are in the field despite the fact that women were pretty much the 
          <br> pioneers of modern day technology. Before I go,I would like to thank every mentour who helped me durring the process especially Azzam.

       My name is Isfar Raiyan. I am 17 years old and I am a junior in Northeast High School. I was always interested in science since childhood
          <br> and I decided that I want to build my career around science which is what intrigued me the most. I am in the engineering club 
          <br> "SPAARC Engineering" in my school where I built a catapult in school along with other students. I try to take advantage of the
          <br> extracurricular activities related to engineering that are available for me. It is a great experience for me to work with 
          <br> many other students who are also intrigued by science. I learned a lot of things about engineering and I want to learn more because
          <br> being a engineer is what I am looking forward to doing.
