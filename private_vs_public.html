              <div class="list-text">Overpopulated classrooms are one of the toughest challenges that public schools suffer from. Students often are unable to have that teacher  student connection unless they attend a magnet school with a lower population such as Constitution High School. 
                This not only affects the student, it also affects the teachers. Public school teachers have enough on their plates through the weeks. When it comes to the time where grades are almost closed, on top of entering grades in they also have students bombarded class, lunch, and even after school hours about their grades.

                One of the best ways that students learn is when we have a connection with a teacher. On top of the fact that this isnâ€™t often achieve in overpopulated schools, 
                students attending public schools in Philadelphia typically never have teachers who look like them. The following graph shows the data for teachers racial backgrounds compared to the students.
